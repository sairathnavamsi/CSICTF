First I have downloaded and opened the JPEG file and saw the UK flag...........
Then, opened it with a zip compression tool to find out 3 files, x.mp3, y.mp3 , z.gz
After listening to the audio, i thought that there might be a flag in their waveforms so i have openn it with audio editing software (audacity).
I have observed the waveforms at different levels as well as the spectogram for some kind of clue.
Then i've checked for LSB steganography with a tool called Silenteye.
Finally, i've opened the z.gz to find sox which is audio editing software, so i have merged both x.mp3 and y.mp3 parallelly and tried all the above mentioned ways once again.
I have opened them with mediainfo tool and there is nothing special except that they have same length and are 64bit, so i have listened to the audio again.
The sounds are similar and almost change their tones at same intervals, so i have figured that this is some kind of signal...
After a loooot of googling and listening to various signals i figured that this is similar to SSTV signal, so i've downloaded sstv tool and made an image of the audio file
It automatically changed itself to martin 1 mode. What comes next is a combination of two memes with a distorted qr code like looking image at the bottom half of the picture.
So, i havE scanned both the audio files individually this time and got memes with half of a qr code in each picture.
Then, I cropped the images and merged with an online tool
Scanned with a qr scanner to get the flag!
